      "The Background of Bihar\n",
      "Bihar is a land locked state lying in the eastern part of India. The \n",
      "word Bihar comes from the Sanskrit word Vihara meaning Buddhist \n",
      "Monasteries. Bihar is surrounded by the states of Uttar Pradesh in \n",
      "the West, Jharkhand in the South, West Bengal in the East and Nepal \n",
      "in the North. Bihar was known as Magadha during ancient times \n",
      "and was a centre of education, culture and tradition. One of the \n",
      "greatest empires in ancient India, The Mauryan Empire, rose from \n",
      "Magadha. Buddhism, which is one of the biggest religions in the \n",
      "world, originated in Bihar. Bihar is also home to the ancient Nalanda \n",
      "University, which was a centre of learning established during the 5th \n",
      "century. The ruins of Nalanda University can still be seen in Bihar. \n",
      "Apart from its historic importance, Bihar also played a significant role \n",
      "in India’s freedom struggle.\n",
      "Hindi and Urdu are the official languages of Bihar. Apart from \n",
      "Hindi and Urdu - Bhojpuri, Magadhi, Maithili or Angika are also \n",
      "spoken by the people of Bihar.\n",
      "History of Litti Chokha: The importance of Litti Chokha to Bihar \n",
      "is similar to the importance of Rosogolla to West Bengal. Litti \n",
      "Chokha, a remarkable dish which comes from the state of Bihar, is \n",
      "not only popular in India today, but \n",
      "has also made a special mark globally. \n",
      "Litti Chokha of Bihar, which can be \n",
      "catapulted as the part of their ethos \n",
      "and culture, was originated centuries \n",
      "ago as a staple food in the court of \n",
      "Magadha. With the passage of time, \n",
      "it imbibed the best and most suitable \n",
      "changes in culture that swept through Bihar with the incoming of \n",
      "mighty Mughals who savoured the dish with shorbas and payas, and \n",
      "the exotic Britishers that liked it with curry, and so forth.\n",
      "However, Litti emerged as a ‘brave sepoy’, when the rebels \n",
      "virtually survived on it during the Mutiny of 1857. Tantia Tope, Rani \n",
      "Lakshmi Bai, and the likes chose it as their ‘food for survival’ as it \n",
      "can be baked without any utensils or much water in the jungles and \n",
      "ravines and stays in eat-worthy condition for more than 48 hours. \n",
      "This dish underwent many changes as new rulers came in. During the \n",
      "Mughal period, emperors were served Littis with payas and shorbas1-7. \n",
      "Eventually, Litti came to Bihar and was paired with Chokha. Therustic \n",
      "way of cooking added real flavour to Litti and Chokha but these days \n",
      "it is not possible for people to go rustic, hence we make it either on \n",
      "the gas oven tandoor or the OTG and micro-oven. But the tastes of \n",
      "these are absolutely different from the ones cooked in the earthen way.\n",
      "Rustic way of cooking Litti and Chokha\n",
      "Goitha\n",
      "Goithas are cow dung cakes which are used in many villages even \n",
      "today for cooking, this might sound tacky but it’s true. It’s just not \n",
      "Litti and Chokha which is cooked on these cakes, but people cook a \n",
      "variety of dishes. The taste of the food cooked in Goitha is heavenly \n",
      "good.\n",
      "Wood Charcoal\n",
      "This is another form of rustic cooking, we do this even today. \n",
      "Unlike Goithas, these are easier to handle and easily available. \n",
      "Cooking with wood charcoal is just like barbequing. Wood charcoal \n",
      "adds that earthiness to the food being cooked and that too taste \n",

What you are\\ntrying to achieve when preparing an Indian dish is to\\nimpart the flavour of the various spices to the meat or\\nvegetables that you are cooking. This is done by preparing\\nthe spiced sauces and in some cases by preparing the meat\\nin such a way that it readily accepts the spice flavours. The\\nskill of the Indian cuisine lies in the special methods\\nrequired to bring out the flavour of the spices and to\\nprepare the meat and vegetables; it is by no means\\n.necessary to have special Indian utensils to achieve this.\\nCOOKING RICE\\nThe cooking of rice seems to be another aspect of Indian\\ncooking which Western housewives regard as a problem.\\nOne hears so many stories of how ordinary boiled rice'),\n",

Its popularity is probably due to the fact\\nthat prawns are considered exotic and expensive in most cases, especially in cities which are a long way from the sea.\\nThe original dish of course, used fresh prawns, but most Indian restaurants have to use frozen prawns and this is\\nprobably an advantage as it cuts down the risk of food poisoning! However, using frozen prawns which have to be\\nimported from places like Malaya and Bangladesh inflates the price so it is as well to be completely sure of what you are\\ngoing to do in this dish before you attempt it. When preparing a spiced dish from any sea food which is noted for its\\ndelicate flavour, it is obviously essential to ensure that the spicing does not mar this fresh flavour.

As with most other styles of cooking all manner\\nof vegetables can be used and the following recipe uses aubergines as I think that this is one of the best tasting vegetables\\nwhen cooked in this way. It would be interesting to compare the flavour of baigan boortha to baigan masalewala in the\\nprevious chapter and baigan tamatar in the chapter on northern India.
